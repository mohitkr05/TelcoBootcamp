# Openstack

OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform that provides a set of software tools for building and managing both public and private clouds. It enables organizations to create and manage scalable and flexible infrastructure as a service (IaaS) environments. OpenStack is designed to offer a unified and interoperable solution, allowing users to deploy and manage various components of cloud infrastructure.

Key components of OpenStack include:

- Compute (Nova): Manages the virtual machines (VMs) running on the cloud. It provides on-demand access to computing resources and supports various hypervisors like KVM, VMware, and others.
- Storage (Swift and Cinder):
  - Swift: Object storage system for storing and retrieving large amounts of unstructured data.
  - Cinder: Block storage component that provides persistent block-level storage for virtual machines.

- Networking (Neutron): Manages network connectivity in the cloud, allowing users to define and manage networks and IP addresses.
- Dashboard (Horizon): A web-based user interface that provides a graphical interface for users to interact with and manage OpenStack resources.
- Identity Service (Keystone): Manages authentication and authorization across all OpenStack services. It provides a centralized identity and access management system.
- Image Service (Glance): Manages virtual machine images, making it easy to discover, register, and deploy VM images.
- Orchestration (Heat): Enables automated deployment and management of cloud applications by defining templates that describe the infrastructure and resources needed.
- Telemetry (Ceilometer): Collects and manages data on the usage of cloud resources, providing metrics and usage statistics.
- Database Service (Trove): Provides database as a service (DBaaS), allowing users to manage relational databases.
